The NumPy library is ubiquitous in data science, as well as a whole bunch of other fields. It enables powerful computing with N-dimensional arrays, and faster calculations due to storage efficient data structures.From the Numpy website:\n",

If you execute a code that you suspect might fail for some particular reason, or if you just want to make sure your code runs through till the end without failing at certain problem spots, you can enclose the tricky code in a try block, and if this code generates an error, the code in the following except block will be executed.

    "We used Google Colab during this workshop, which provided us with a powerful virtual machine and a Python-notebook environment to code in. However if you wish to run code on your own computers, you would have to install Python on your computers, and use an editor to write your code. There are some highly user-friendly editors out there, called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which provide you with several features. Look up [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (the editor most similar to the one we are using right now).\n",
