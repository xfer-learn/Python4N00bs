# Python4N00bs
Introductory workshop on Python programming

## Description
In this series of courses, we will go over the basics of the Python programming language, starting from simple code to display “Hello, world!” on the screen, and covering Pythonic data structures, advanced coding syntax, file handling, usage of common external libraries for data handling and plotting, functional programming, and finishing with the basics of Object Oriented Programming. This course is intended for absolute beginners in programming, i.e. people who have never written a single line of code before this, but is also intended to be comprehensive and to provide a strong foundation in programming to the students who participate. There will be homework assignments each week, and several resources provided for you to continue studying Python after the workshops are done.

## Notebooks
Each week we will go through a notebook and fill in the coding exercises. You can then save the completed notebooks in your drives, and you will have access to them after the course is done. Here are the links to the notebooks with text and skeleton code:
