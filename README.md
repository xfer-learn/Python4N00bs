# Python4N00bs
Introductory workshop on Python programming

## Description
In this series of courses, we will go over the basics of the Python programming language, starting from simple code to display “Hello, world!” on the screen, and covering Pythonic data structures, advanced coding syntax, file handling, usage of common external libraries for data handling and plotting, functional programming, and finishing with the basics of Object Oriented Programming. This course is intended for absolute beginners in programming, i.e. people who have never written a single line of code before this, but is also intended to be comprehensive and to provide a strong foundation in programming to the students who participate. There will be homework assignments each week, and several resources provided for you to continue studying Python after the workshops are done.

## Notebooks
Each week we will go through a notebook and fill in the coding exercises. You can then save the completed notebooks in your drives, and you will have access to them after the course is done. Here are the links to the notebooks with text and skeleton code:
* [Notebook 01](./Python4n00bs_day_01.ipynb)
* [Notebook 02](./Python4n00bs_day_02.ipynb)
* [Notebook 03](./Python4n00bs_day_03.ipynb)
* [Notebook 04](./Python4n00bs_day_04.ipynb)

## Assignments
You will work on a set of exercises each week to reinforce the concepts you learned in that week's class. Here are the links to the files containing the assignments:
* [Exercises Week 01](./Exercises/SharedExercises.pdf)
* [Exercises Week 02](./Exercises/FileExercises.pdf)
* [Exercises Week 03](./Exercises/FunctionExercises.pdf)

## Solutions
Here you will find solutions to the exercises. There are many different ways of solving the same problem in Python, so these solutions are not the only possible solutions to the exercises. Try to solve the exercises on your own, and only refer to the solutions if you are completely stuck:
