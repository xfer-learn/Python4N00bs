    "One of the most useful libraries, that is used in many, many applications, is the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library. The NumPy library is ubiquitous in data science, as well as a whole bunch of other fields. It enables powerful computing with N-dimensional arrays, and faster calculations due to storage efficient data structures.From the Numpy website:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n",
    "* a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    "* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We use numpy with image analysis, with data engineering, and with many other scientific applications.\n",

    "Installing NumPy is very simple. Use the Python package management system \"pip\" as follows:  \n",
    "pip install numpy\n",

    "### 5. Wrapping up\n",
    "You've learned a lot today! You now have all the skills to write some pretty powerful code in Python. You will soon put these skills to the test when you work on your projects. Some information you might find useful for your future experiments in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):\n",
    "We used Google Colab during this workshop, which provided us with a powerful virtual machine and a Python-notebook environment to code in. However if you wish to run code on your own computers, you would have to install Python on your computers, and use an editor to write your code. There are some highly user-friendly editors out there, called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which provide you with several features. Look up [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (the editor most similar to the one we are using right now).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further resources:\n",
    "You have access to the Python notebook we worked with today, and you can also use these resources to further your knowledge of Python programming and become more proficient.  \n",
    "1. [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python): A series of online courses offered by the University of Michigan, which starts from the absolute basics of programming, and takes you to a high level of proficiency. It is comprehensive, yet easy to follow.\n",
    "2. [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): A website with multiple online courses on various topics, including Python programming, fundamentals of data science, and machine learning.\n",
    "3. [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/): A course that covers several concepts in Python, which can be completed in a few days to a week or two of serious study."
